<p>The ecological space time continuum. All sites share the same STM, but with dials that turn the probability of different triggers and species success. Shifting sites turns the dials. Shifting climate or management regimes does the same thing. At either end of the continuum, a different set of community phases are zeroed out.</p>
<p>In a rich niche within a rich ecoregion, there might be multiple possible dominant species of the same functional species guild. Alternative plant associations within the same functional community phase are not a driven by any of the triggers that would justify an arrow and a changed box, but are instead due to random population variability and founder effects. Sample size may also limit the representativeness of the sample depending on the size of individuals or clonal patches relative to the plot dimensions.</p>
<p>Spatial context and scale is a missing dimension in our current products. When patch size is reduced, or is affected by edge, the function may change, even if we maintain the same overstory. We need to somehow represent this in a STM. Community composition will probably change in the long term, but relict patches of a reference may already be effectively in an alternative state from their fragmentation. There is a term “extinction debt” meaning that once a habitat and populations are decimated, it is a matter of time for remaining individuals to expire, and for loss of connectivity to prevent colonization as reproductive success of any given individual is not a sure thing.</p>
<p>A fine line between pine plantation and a restored pine forest. The intensity of management after the first planting to manipulate species composition is key.</p>
<p>I have often wondered whether we needed optional structural maturity phase within a community phase to convey size/age specific conservation data. Broadly speaking Kirtland’s Warbler only nests in jack pine woodlands, but only a specific early window of stand maturity (tree height and density are key). Species composition not change enough to justify separate community phase. Similarly, old-growth phases also have large woody debris, snags, and cavity trees that are absent from younger early-mature phases. Generally age and development are assumed attributes within the community phase, but there may be management need to separate stages. If a reference has an age distribution we should at least be capable of showing whether existing samples are representative of the reference condition in age distribution.</p>
<p>I haven’t completely bought into the nested box paradigm in STMs other than as a convenience to allow for the multiple reference community phases to share the same arrow when converting to other land uses. Theoretically, each community phase would have a potentially unique set of actions required to affect a land use change (e.g. forested phases require more tree cutting than more open phases. Rather than the extra box it almost makes more sense to condition the thickness of the box or the arrow to the energy required to make that transition/pathway happen. We know that there is some asymmetry in the reference state that would make some box “walls” thicker than others. If we started to attribute properties directly to the box related to physical structure, environmental constraints, and disturbance regimes, then any arrow attempted to be drawn between any box would auto populate the arrow with a set of mathematical differences among those attributes. This would automatically filter the set of triggers/actions which are able to propagate such changes. The energy required to conduct such triggers or actions is inherit in the type of trigger or action in context to prevailing conditions. Of course a change in prevailing condition (e.g. climate) that makes an action require lower energy is itself among the triggers or at least it acts as a catalyst when not enough to trigger it by itself. Think of a chemistry equation, when each of a set of reagents have a different energy potentials, the difference among these potentials across the equation is used to determine whether the reaction would require energy or be spontaneous. As a person mostly doing inventory, it is difficult to know the relationship among all potential land uses. We are generally not witness to how people have managed their land for it to reach its current state. Only USFS or NPS is likely to know enough history to say anything about long term history. So unless we have this historical data, it would be better to focus on collecting empirical data and build a system which makes conservative inferences based on the data. Then as historic data becomes available, more specificity can be applied.</p>
<p>I would rather list the management or environmental triggers that can cause a reversal, and then rate the reversibility as a contextual judgement call.</p>
<p>A distinction should be made more explicit whether it is a singular event or a systemic change in reoccurring processes. For example, sometimes a single catastrophic fire is what does it. Other times is requires that a change in frequency of less intense fires. Perhaps this is a separate dimension to populate, having the nature and magnitude of the trigger, and a periodicity. I think that triggers need to be polarized according to what property of climate or weather is changing, or else when illustrating the relationship between two states or phases, you might end up with the same trigger in both directions.</p>
<p>I like that management actions are separate from natural triggers. To some extent they can be paired up as alternative parallel arrows to maintain the same community phase relationships. In a sense the need for the use of management to maintain the community renders the state as an managed state (an artificial copy of the reference), but theoretically, were natural processes able to be restored, the model would resume with the same set of community phases.</p>
<p>Certainly, some forest composition continues to change well beyond this, with only half the height growth in some forests. But 100+ years is reasonably sufficient for most late species to establish, though mortality of large early species is not yet kicking in. Some forests never get too old before disturbance opens it up to renew those species though.</p>
<p>I thought that the value laden “restoration” would be retired. Yes, generally we might say restore to a reference state, but sometimes it is to an alternative less bad or desirable alternative state. It is in the eye of the beholder. We should stay neutral and just collect data needed to inform the decision, and allow the end user call it restoration.</p>
