[["index.html", "Essentials of Vegetation Data Chapter 1 What is Vegetation? 1.1 Strata", " Essentials of Vegetation Data Greg J. Schmidt 2023-03-21 Chapter 1 What is Vegetation? There are two main attributes of vegetation: structure and composition. Structure is the physical manifestation of the plant community, including cover and height. Composition is the identity and abundance of the plant taxa making up the vegetation. Abundance can be rated as canopy cover, foliar cover, or biomass. According to the USNVC standard (FGDC 2008), canopy or crown cover is the most universal way to rate vegetation, as it is most closely coorelated to estimates of cover from remote sensing (aerial photos), though foliar cover might seem more correlated with leaf area index as determined by MODIS and Landsat satellites. (citation?). 1.1 Strata Height in vegetation inventory is organized into strata. The most basic is the distinction between overstory and understory. However, the US National Vegetation Classification (FGDC 2008) prescribes a tree stratum (5+ m), shrub stratum (0.5-5 m), and a field stratum (0-0.5 m) for all terrestrial vascular plants, a non-vascular stratum (0 m) for bryophytes and lichens, and a submerged stratum (&lt; 0m) for aquatic plants. Stratum membership is based on the height of perennial buds or annual seeds, therefore Herbaceous plants are considered to be the field stratum regardless of the height of the plant, unless they are established as an epiphyte in the canopy of woody plants. Taxon status as a tree is based on its potential to reach the overstory, regardless of its present height. A liana (woody vine) is able to occupy any height stratum, but on as long as it has physical support as evidence by trees or shrubs at the same height or higher. Figure 1. Overstory includes all vegetation taller than 5 m (16.4 ft), and can be subdivided into subcanopy and canopy strata at 15 m (±5 m) Figure 2. Understory includes all vegetation less than or equal to 5 m (16.4 ft), and is subdivided into a field or herb stratum at less than 0.5 m (1.6 ft) and shrub stratum at 0.5-5 m.

We choose protocols according to how efficiently or accurately they perform in measuring vegetation properties. Databases should be constructed around these natural properties, not around protocols. Our descriptions are independent of aspirations of the land owner (land use) and regulatory status of vegetation. Though we may accommodate different users who need specific properties to be measured, we do not need to know how a given user would use the data in order for the minimum data set to be collected. All vegetation will share a basic set of natural properties, while some other properties may be life form specific (e.g. stem diameter and basal area for trees). All vegetation has three classes of properties: species composition; an abundance measure; and a structure or height value. Abundance measures can be canopy cover, foliar cover, biomass, and frequency, but each is a different property which may entail different protocols to measure. USNVC considers canopy cover is the most universal form of abundance to record, while other forms of abundance are favored by specialized end users. Adjusting the intensity and speed of vegetation inventory should consider this order of priority. The order of importance is: Species identity Abundance Structure Life form and end user needs specific properties. 2.1 Tier 1 Species* (*genus for uncertain species) checklist accounting for at least 50% relative importance values (e.g. canopy cover). Life form or growth habit is mostly a property tied to species identity, which caries an emergent property to the vegetation. However, it can be substituted for species in the most uninformed vegetation descriptions Additional option for biodiversity Comprehensive species* checklist with total importance values (e.g. canopy cover) 2.2 Tier 2 Comprehensive species* checklist with canopy cover by stratum. Required strata are field, shrub, and tree according to USNVC definitions, but may be subdivided further to indicate overstory structure and recruitment. Additional option for trees Record basal area by species for dominant live trees &gt; 10 cm wide and &gt;5 m tall. May use estimate from variable radius plot. 2.3 Tier 3 Comprehensive species* checklist with canopy cover by stratum. Required strata are field, shrub, and tree according to USNVC definitions, but may be subdivided further to indicate overstory structure and recruitment. Record actual height of the top and bottom of the dominant foliage by species within each stratum, or at least the dominant stratum for each dominant species. Record basal area and range in diameters (DBH) by species should be recorded for dominant live trees &gt; 10 cm wide and &gt;5 m tall. May use estimate from variable radius plot. May use estimate from variable radius plot. Can also opt to census all tree diameters fixed area plot, but summary diameter should be equivalent to quadradic mean diameter. Additional options for dead structure Basal area should include snags &gt;10 cm wide and &gt;2 m tall. A ground surface cover transect should be used to assess down woody debris and leaf litter coverage (litter thickness?). Line-point intercepts (e.g. intervals of half a meter) can be done to estimate smaller woody debris and leaf litter, whereas a continuous line intercept may be more efficient for assaying larger woody debris (&gt; 10 cm). The two methods need to be talleyed separately before the percentage cover totals are combined. Additional options for carbon sequestration potential/productivity and grazing Biomass and/or annual biomass for productivity.

"],["vegetation-databases.html", "Chapter 3 Vegetation Databases 3.1 VegLog MS Access Database 3.2 Vegetation Plot Object in NASIS", " Chapter 3 Vegetation Databases 3.1 VegLog MS Access Database Relevé plot data is collected in a way that optimizes efficiency and quality control in the field, but is not suitable for NASIS (National Soil Information System) in its current form. Field collection datasheet allows cover data for up to 4 strata to be recorded in a single row, ensuring that an observed plant taxon need only be listed once per plot. This avoids the need to recursively scan for the same taxon multiple times to ensure that the occupancy of each stratum is recorded appropriately. However, NASIS records each taxon-stratum incidence as independent rows. Additionally, Relevé protocol (DNR 2013) is based on SI (International System of Units) as are all soil pedon description protocols, but NASIS currently only allows for legacy protocols based on USC (US customary) units to be entered. Prior to entering data into NASIS (National Soil Information System), it is recommended that it first be entered into the custom MS Access Database VegLog. Select user name. Startup Form Site data Observed Sites Enter GSP coordinates in decimal degrees of each plot location. If need be, enter degrees, minutes, seconds at the bottom to auto calculate decimal degrees in current record. Taxon data Site (observed plants tab) Enter species list. Use genus and specific epithet autolookup fields. Enter all the cover values of each of 4 strata. The default heights are 0-0.5, 0.5-5, 5-15, and 15+ meters, but this can be adjusted. Enter basal area of taxon based on variable radius plot as determined by prism or angle gauge. May need to adjust BAF (basal area factor) if not USC BAF base 10. SI BAF 2 is also supported. Enter the maximum and minimum of observed live crown height of dominant (highest) stratum of the taxon in meters. After entering all the data for the plot, use the button to auto populate these heights to their appropriate height within stratum. Live crown heights can also be manually specified for the lower strata in the additional columns, but paper forms may not have the extra columns, and it is relatively redundant information (presence in highest stratum demonstrates capability of taxon to occupy full height range any lower stratum also present). Enter the maximum and minimum diameters (DBH - diameter at breast height) in centimeters of trees observed to fall within the basal area plot (variable radius plot). Other Vegetation details and processing Site (vegetation tab) Enter total cover for each stratum (if zero, leave blank). Synonymize Plant Taxa (assigns PLANTS symbols). Aggregate Cover to show current estimate of aggregate cover, then Transform Overstory and Transform Understory to adjust individual cover values to be more consistent with observed whole stratum cover. Reports (conversions to NASIS) Site (Reports tab) Paste to NASIS to convert to USC units and serialize taxon by stratum data. 3.2 Vegetation Plot Object in NASIS Tips: Row entries save in the local database when you advance to the next record. But if in last new row, the record needs to be saved manually with the end edit green check button at bottom of screen, prior to saving all records (upload) to the national database. After saving to the national database, remember to check in the records to unlock them for future edits. You may rearrange the columns by dragging them to reflect the datasheet that you are copying from. Create new record in Vegetation Plot table. Assign plot record to the appropriate user Site ID and observation date, or create new observation if different from pedon observation date. Name user user vegplot id the same as site id, but may append suffix of P to indicate plot, or T to indicate transect, given that the observation dates can differ and require different observation records. There are two ways to enter the species composition records: 1. By column (faster); by row. Enter species as it appears on your datasheet. You may either enter the full Latin name or enter the PLANTS symbol if you’ve conducted a lookup query in the source database where data was initially entered. If entering by column, proceed with entering each name, vertically before entering the data for other columns, using the down arrow to advance to the next new record. The same species may be entered multiple times. Take care that the sort order of the rows remains consistent with the order on your datasheet to ensure that data entered by column remains correlated properly (not a problem if completing each column of each new row horizontally). You may sort by any of the columns by pressing on the column name; to restore original order of entry, sort by Rec ID on the far right. Select the appropriate growth habit in the Plant Type Group. Every species should have a default value established that is the same regardless of the stature in existing plot record; see regional ecologist if you need a list of accepted values. For by column entry, most entries require only first one or two letters of the growth form, followed by enter, then arrow down. Select the appropriate Plant Nativity, based on whether a taxon is considered native to the state where the inventory was recorded. See BONAP to determine the nativity status. Some species are native to North America, but are considered “adventive” to a state on the BONAP website; select “introduced” in these instances. Select “unknown” for species with both native and introduced genotypes (e.g. Phalaris arundinacea). Enter all the Species Canopy Cover Percent to the nearest whole percent. If rounding down to zero, you need to select the Spp Trace Amount Flag checkbox. Advance to each record using the down arrow. For each species stratum entry, there is a Height Class Lower Limit and Height Class Upper Limit. These are typically based on federal government vegetation standards (FGDC 2008) lower stratum heights converted from meters to feet: 0 to 1.6; 1.6 to 16.4; 16.4 to user define limits for upper strata (e.g. 16.4 to 49.2 and 49.2 to 98.4). To ensure data integrity of original SI units, do not round to the nearest whole number. Enter Live Canopy Ht Bottom and Live Canopy Ht Top the height range of the typical crowns for current taxon within current stratum. The top height is generally going to be within the upper and lower range for the stratum. The canopy bottom can range below the range of the stratum, because the stratum only reflects the top heights of plants in that stratum, while the lowest live branches can extend below that height. Often this is only recorded for the uppermost stratum of the taxon, as it can be safely assumed that the live canopy of lower strata can encompass the whole range of the stratum over time. To ensure data integrity of original recorded SI units, do not round to the nearest whole number. Enter Overstory DBH Minimum and Overstory DBH Maximum as inches converted from centimeters. To ensure data integrity of original recorded SI units, do not round to the nearest whole number. Typically, this is only recorded for trees in the uppermost stratum for the taxon. Enter Basal Area by Spp. This is typically based on tree count with a prism, multiplied by a factor. If using a USC factor ten prism, the count is multiplied by ten and entered as is. If using an SI factor two prism, you must convert it to USC; this is less common due to a shortage of SI equipment domestically. To ensure data integrity if originally recorded using SI units, do not round to the nearest whole number. Other remaining columns are optional Vegetation Strata Level only recognizes overstory and understory. If using this column, the overstory strata are those more than 5 m or 16.4 ft. Spp DBH Average is really the quadratic mean diameter if you use a prism to select trees to measure. You can enter each tree diameter individually, but this would need to go into the Plot Tree Inventory table.
